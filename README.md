# Heroes App


## Hero repository of fan favorite Marvel and DC heroes

This is a hero repository application with various details of fan favorite Marvel and DC heroes. This application is using a local database for the heroes and local assests with downloaded images for each hero, so the entire application is local and purely frontend.

## Instrucctions

The application has 5 pages:

- Marvel page
- DC Page
- Search Page
- Hero Page
- Login Page

To access the Marvel and DC pages just click on the navbar on the top of the page, this also has the search option where you can search for any hero by name. Clicking on the Details option in any Hero card takes you to their individual hero page with aditional information of that hero. You can also log out by clicking the Logout option in the navbar.
